## Distribution Regression for Sequential Data

### Definitions/Unfamiliar Terms:
- Expected signature: A signature of a path is a sequence of iterated integrals that encodes the shape of the path. The expected signature is then the expectation (average) of these signatures over a distribution of random paths.
- Signature kernel trick: instead of explicitly computing all signature terms (which is infinite and expensive), you use a kernel function that directly computes the inner product between signatures of two paths.

### Abstract
Focus: Inputs are complex data streams (sequential/time-series data).
Methodology:
- Uses the expected signature (from stochastic analysis).
- Applies a signature kernel trick for sequential data.
- Proposes two approaches:
   - Feature-based method (better when few data streams, high dimensionality).
   - Kernel-based method (better when many data streams, lower dimensionality).
Theory: Both approaches are shown to be universal (theoretically sound).
Results: State-of-the-art empirical performance on synthetic and real-world datasets (thermodynamics, finance, agriculture).

### Introduction
Definition: Distribution regression (DR) on sequential data means learning a mapping from a group of data streams (time series) to a single target value.
Examples:
- Thermodynamics → estimate gas temperature from particle trajectories.
- Finance → estimate mean-reversion parameters from market dynamics.
- Agriculture → predict crop yield from high-resolution climate data.
Prior work: DR has been applied to vector inputs and extended to images and persistence diagrams, but sequential data (multivariate time series) remains underexplored.
Challenges with sequential data:
- Sequences are ordered (non-exchangeable).
- Observations may be irregularly spaced in time.
Contribution of this paper:
- Proposes a framework for DR on sequential data streams, modeled as Lipschitz continuous paths.
